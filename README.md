# Digital-thermohygrometer-for-plants
I created this project when I was in university, for a discipline called "Embedded systems".
This project is supposed to monitor the soil humidity and air temperature around a plant, using sensors. The plant's situation is shown using a LED and a message on a LCD display. 

Max temp: 35 degrees Celsius, min temp: 10 degrees Celsius

Adequate soil humidity: between 20 and 80%

A too low or too high value of these parameters triggers a buzzer, in order to warn the human about the plant's disconfort.

This repository contains the following:
- A presentation of the project in pdf and pptx format, in Romanian;
- The block diagram of the connections, in drawio;
- Some photos of how I implemented and tested the project;
- The code for Arduino Uno
